        <h3>THE GONDOLIERS</h3>
        <h4> ACT I - The Piazzetta, Venice</h4>
        <p>           
  FRANC.    Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
  These floral tributes extraordinary?<br>

FIA.      For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
  The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.<br>

GIU.      They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
  To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.<br>

ANT.      Do all you maidens love them?<br>

ALL.                                    Passionately!<br>

ANT.      These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!<br>

GIOR.     But what of us, who one and all adore you?
  Have pity on our passion, we implore you!<br>

FIA.      These gentlemen must make their choice before you;<br>

VIT.      In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.<br>

GIU.      When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
  Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.<br>

FIA. and VIT.  Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.<br>

ANT.      With pleasure, nobody contradicente!<br>

            SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.<br>

       For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,<br>
       That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;<br>
            With loving and laughing,<br>
            And quipping and quaffing,<br>
       We're happy as happy can be, tra la—<br>
            With loving and laughing, etc.<br>

       With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,<br>
       And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;<br>
            And Jealousy yellow,<br>
            Unfortunate fellow,<br>
       We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—<br>
            And Jealousy yellow, etc.<br>

FIA. (looking off). See, see, at last they come to make their
choice—<br>
       Let us acclaim them with united voice.<br>
(Marco and Giuseppe appear in gondola at back.)<br>

CHORUS (Girls).     Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!
Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.<br>
            Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!<br>

(Marco and Giuseppe jump ashore—the Girls salute them.)<br>

 DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE, with CHORUS OF GIRLS.<br>

MAR. and GIU.  Buon' giorno, signorine!<br>

GIRLS.              Gondolieri carissimi!<br>
       Siamo contadine!<br>

MAR. and GIU. (bowing).  Servitori umilissimi!
            Per chi questi fiori—<br>
                 Questi fiori bellissimi?<br>

GIRLS.              Per voi, bei signori
                 O eccellentissimi!<br>

(The Girls present their bouquets to Marco and Giuseppe, who are
overwhelmed with them, and carry them with difficulty.)<br>

MAR. and GIU. (their arms full of flowers). O ciel'! O ciel'!<br>

GIRLS.                             Buon' giorno, cavalieri!<br>
