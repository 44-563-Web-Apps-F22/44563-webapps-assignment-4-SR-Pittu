        <h3>THE GONDOLIERS</h3>
        <h4> ACT I - The Piazzetta, Venice</h4>
        <p>  
<h5>FRANC.</h5> 
<p >Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
  These floral tributes extraordinary?</p>
<h5>FIA. </h5>
<p>For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
  The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.</p>
<h5>GIU. </h5>
<p>They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
  To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.</p>
<h5>ANT.</h5> 
<p>Do all you maidens love them?</p>
<h5>ALL.   </h5> 
<p>Passionately!</p>
<h5>ANT.</h5> 
<p>These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!</p>
<h5>GIOR. </h5> 
<p> But what of us, who one and all adore you?
  Have pity on our passion, we implore you!</p>
<h5>FIA. </h5>
<p>  These gentlemen must make their choice before you;</p>
<h5>VIT. </h5> 
<p> In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.</p>
<h5>GIU. </h5>     
<p>When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
  Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.</p>
<h5>FIA. and VIT.</h5>  
<p>Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.</p>
<h5>ANT.</h5>     With pleasure, nobody contradicente!</p>
           <h4>SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.</h4>
       <p>  For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,<br>
       That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;<br>
            With loving and laughing,<br>
            And quipping and quaffing,<br>
       We're happy as happy can be, tra la—<br>
            With loving and laughing, etc.<br>

       With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,<br>
       And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;<br>
            And Jealousy yellow,<br>
            Unfortunate fellow,<br>
       We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—<br>
            And Jealousy yellow, etc.<br></p>

<h5>FIA.</h5> 
<p> (looking off).</p> 
<p>See, see, at last they come to make their
choice—<br>Let us acclaim them with united voice.</p>
<p>(Marco and Giuseppe appear in gondola at back.)</p>
<h4>CHORUS. </h4> 
<p>(Girls).</p>  
<p>Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!
Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!</p>
